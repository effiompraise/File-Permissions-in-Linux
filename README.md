# File-Permissions-in-Linux
As a cybersecurity analyst, I have been tasked to examine existing permissions on the file system. This means that I need to determine if the permissions match the authorization that should be given. If they do not match, Iâ€™ll need to modify the permissions to authorize the appropriate users and remove any unauthorized access.
